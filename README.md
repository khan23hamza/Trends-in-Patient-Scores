This project is transforming patient scores from HCAHPS/CMS from Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals.
A machine learning model was also created to help predict scores in the future.
The objective is to analyze patient reviews from 2017 to March 2024 to identify any trend in patient satisfaction scores, yearly, monthly, seasonal, random or not changing overall.

The dataset is too large to be uploaded to GitHub but the same can be done by visiting https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4j6d-yzce to be able to download the data in order to be able to mimic what was done.
The link provided is Jefferson CMS reviews but any hospital CMS reviews can be download by searching on https://www.medicare.gov/

15 of the 29 original CMS questions were combined to generate an overall CMS score by changing all categorical values to numeric to a 1-4 rating.

The data was cleaned and transformed in many ways but overall most of it was the same for future projects.

An Excel sheet was uploaded mapping all the column headers to its question aligned with the HCAHPS survey.
